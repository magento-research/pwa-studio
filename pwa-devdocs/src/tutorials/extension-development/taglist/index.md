title: Create a tag list extension
---

A tag list is a list of tag groups associated with a product.
This tutorial provides steps for creating and installing an extension that displays a tag list on the product details page in a Venia-based storefront.

## Prerequisites

Before you start this tutorial, make sure you have a storefront project set up using the steps outlined in the [Setup your project][] topic.
This is the storefront you will use to install your extension in this tutorial.

## Set up your extension project

Create a folder anywhere in your system and run Yarn's project creation script.
The script starts an interactive questionnaire that helps you fill out your project's `package.json` file.

```sh
mkdir tagList && \
cd tagList && \
yarn init
```

## Create TagList component files
